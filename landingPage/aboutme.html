                For as long as I can remember I have loved the art of creating and building. At a young age I was given the chance to work in construction with my uncle. We focused mainly on custom woodworking, which I quickly found a satisfaction in. The satisfaction I had wasn’t from the finished art piece though, it was from the entire process; creating an idea, taking a raw piece of material and finding a way to turn that into what your audience desires, the sound of the saw, the smell of the wood, the fasteners that tie all the pieces together, hand sanding to a smooth perfection. I found a joy in the development of things.

                After working with my uncle for a few years, I suffered a hand injury that would no longer allow me to continue working in construction. This is when I took my love for computers into high gear. I have always enjoyed computers, as I did woodworking, for the process they undergo to produce something amazing. When I choose to make computers and programing my career, I had only had experience working with computers and languages outside of the workforce, but just like the obstacle with my hand I have never let a challenge hold me back.

                As I continued along with my career, I’ve found joy in the challenges that have come along with learning new computer languages and how to implement them into the workforce to produce an efficient product. Creating a script to automate a task or taking an idea and developing an application from a process that is currently done manually gave me a similar sense of accomplishment and enjoyment that construction had given me; it brought me back to the process that I had fallen for.

                I find writing to be an amazing art, as you create and build this idea line by line and develop this amazing finished product. With my current position I am surrounded by different languages and given the opportunities to apply those languages, which has lead me to take various online courses and find books to help develop my skill set. I know with this course, the support of my wife and leadership within my current position that I will be able to move quickly into the junior softwear engineering position at The Home Depot and continue to work towards my goal of becoming a softwear engineer.
